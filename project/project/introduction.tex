\section{WORKING AND ITS PRINCIPLE}
\subsection{WORKING}
\paragraph{}There are three essential components to a laser security system: a laser, a detector,MEGA Aurdino,SIM Module and sensing circuit. The laser is a concentrated light source that puts out a straight line, 'pencil beam, of light of a single colour. The detector is sensitive to light and puts out a voltage when the laser light  hits  it.  The detector  is  connected  to  the  sensing  circuit.  When  the  laser  beam  is interrupted and cannot reach the detector, its voltage output changes, and the circuit sense the change and put out a warning signal

\subsection{PRINCIPLE}
\paragraph{}Laser light travels in a straight line. For instance, to protect the front of the yard, putting the laser at one comer and the detector at the other corner would do the job. That's not a very practical configuration, though. More typically, if it is needed to protect the perimeter of a room, or at least the enhances. So laser security systems start with a laser pointing to a small mirror. The first mirror is angled to direct the beam to a second small mirror, and so on until the final mirror directs the beam to the detector. If the beam is interrupted anywhere between the laser and the detector, the electronics will put the warning signal.
