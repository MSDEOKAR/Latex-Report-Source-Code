\large{\paragraph{}This project deals with a model of laser security alarm system design. 
Laser security systems used to be difficult to install and rarely available to anyone other than the super-rich. Now, there are dozens of different security systems on the market that utilize lasers and can effectively protect everything from small apartments and businesses to large areas of property. Most home laser security systems consist of two parts: a basic alarm unit and an infrared motion detector. Laser based security system is a type of security and alarm system that uses laser light and a light sensor}
\large{\paragraph{}The Arduino Mega is based on ATmega2560 Microcontroller. The ATmega2560 is an 8-bit microcontroller. We need a simple USB cable to connect to the computer and the AC to DC adapter or battery to get started with it.The Arduino Mega is organized using the Arduino (IDE), which can run on various platforms. Here, IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment.The functioning of the Arduino Mega is similar to other Arduino Boards. We need not require extra components for its working.
The ATmega2560 Microcontroller is consistent with most of the shields of Arduino UNO.}\\
