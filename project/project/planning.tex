\section{ADVANTAGES:}

These are easy to install and work at both within as well as outside houses. These are very effective perimeter alarm systems around properties. In indoor systems can utilize the normal power outlets and jacks making them inconspicuous. At outside these can be easily be hidden behind the bushes or plants without causing any damage. They consume less power when compared to the laser system as the whole, which is expensive.
These laser systems can be installed in homes either by self or by hiring a technical person. By technological innovations cost of the security systems has been cut to a large extent. So, making laser systems one among affordable security system options can be very safe.
Lasers are strong in beam width and can be focused on the perfect target. By using laser security system one can be safe in the case of harmful effects to the body. As the beam width used in the laser security systems are not strong beam widths. 
The circuit, construction and setup for the Laser Security System are very simple. If used with a battery, the laser security system can work even when there is a power outage.

\section{DISADVANTAGES:}

a)The laser security system works only if the laser is obstructed. If the intruder passes without obstructing the laser, it is considered as a failure.
\\
b)In order to secure a larger area, we need more lasers and corresponding sensors.
