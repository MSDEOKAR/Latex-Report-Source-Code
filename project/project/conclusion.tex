\section{Conclusion}


\paragraph{}Laser security system provides us the security against any crime, theft in our day to day life and so people are installing them in order to stay safe, secure and sound. Various electronic security systems can be used at home and other important working places for security and safety purposes. It is a great opportunity and source of saving man power contributing no wastage of electricity. The "Laser Security System" is an important helping system. Using this system robbery, thefts and crime can be avoided to large extend. Avoiding thieves results in the safety of our financial assets and thereby this system provides us protection against all.The Laser and LDR system is highly sensitive with a great range of working. The system senses  the  light  emitted  by  the  Laser  falling  over  the  LDR  connected  with  the  circuit. Whenever the beam of light is interrupted by any means, it triggers the alarm or siren. This highly reactive approach has low computational requirement, therefore it is well suited to surveillance, industrial application and smart environments.
